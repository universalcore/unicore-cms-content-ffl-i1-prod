  "content": "**Malaria is a serious disease spread through mosquito bites, and is a leading cause of death, illness, and poor growth and development among young children.**\r\n\r\n**Malaria is also particularly dangerous for pregnant women.** Millions of pregnant women are exposed to malaria each year. Malaria during pregnancy contributes to low-birthweight babies in endemic areas, plus anaemia, stillbirth and even maternal deaths.\r\n\r\n**Malaria is spread by the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito. The mosquito transfers the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, from person to person.** People can get very sick with high fevers, diarrhoea, vomiting, headache, chills or it can be relatively mild and resemble a flu. The disease can however worsen rapidly in children. Children under 5 years old and pregnant women are the most susceptible to malaria. \r\n\r\n**Many lives can be saved by preventing malaria and treating it early.** Children and their family members have the right to quality health care for prompt and effective diagnosis, treatment and malaria prevention.\r\n\r\n**Facts to know about malaria:**\r\n\r\n**1.\tMalaria is transmitted through the bite of a mosquito.** Sleeping under a long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito net is the best way to prevent malaria-bearing mosquito bites.\r\n\r\n**2.\tChildren are at high risk if you are in an area where malaria is present.** A child with a fever should be examined immediately by a trained health worker and receive a confirmatory diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment administered as soon as possible if diagnosed with malaria. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are recommended by WHO for treatment of malaria. \r\n\r\n**3.\tMalaria is also very dangerous for pregnant women.** If living in a malaria-endemic area, pregnant women can receive a preventative treatment administered by a trained health worker when they attend ante-natal care and by sleeping under an insecticide-treated mosquito net every night.\r\n\r\n**4.\tA child suffering or recovering from malaria needs plenty of liquids and foods.**\r\n\r\nNext article: ",
